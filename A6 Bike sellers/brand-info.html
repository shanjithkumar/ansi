<h1>BAJAJ PULSAR</h1>

Bigger motorcycles with higher capacity virtually did not exist (except for Royal Enfield Bullet with 350cc and 500cc variants). The launch and success of Hero Honda CBZ in 1999 showed that there was demand for performance bikes. Bajaj took the cue from there on and launched the Pulsar twins (150cc and 180cc) in India on 24 November 2001.[5] Since the introduction and success of Bajaj Pulsar, Indian youth began expecting high power and other features from affordable motorcycles.</p><br>
